## Overview

Hi! This is my attempt with the DevChallenge.io #7 challenge: Edie homepage.

I have a long background developing desktop apps with .NET but I'm a noob developing for web. For now, I have only acquired knowledge in HTML and CSS and I am taking my first steps in Sass and SUIT CSS methology, so I've tried to use it here.

### Built With

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)


## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/xobQBuf8zWWmiYMIAZe0) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
